== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the browser phone require flash? =

The browser phone does require flash to use your computer's mic. We are working
	on a version with a "call me back" option, so users without flash (for instance
	users on an iPhone or Android device) will still be able to use the phone.

= Why does my theme look different after installing your plugin? =

This might happen if your theme does not support the IE 8 browser. Since Phono 
	currently requires IE 8 standards mode to be enabled, this forces your 
	theme into IE 8 mode on compatible browsers. This shouldn't affect much,
	if any, themes as most themes support IE 8 out of the box. We are working
	on fixing this problem.
