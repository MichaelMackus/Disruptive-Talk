== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the browser phone require flash? =

The browser phone does require flash to use your computer's mic. We are working
	on a version with a "call me back" option, so users without flash (for instance
	users on an iPhone or Android device) will still be able to use the phone.

= Why doesn't the widget work in Microsoft's Internet Explorer? =

There is a bug in the widget breaking it in Internet Explorer. We are working on
	a fix for this.
